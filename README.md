# AutonomousRoboticCar or ARC for short
This is the code for the car I'm entering into the 2016 ITT Car race.  We had all kinds of names for the project:  RAR - Robotic Autonomous Racer, BHD - Bad Hair Day (THe wires were a complete mess at one point)

* Current activity is to tame the wiring better with connectors.  This will help keep wires connected even in the event of a crash.  From there we need to test mobility with pre-programmed instructions.  Find the sweet sot with the proper number of LiPo batteries: 2? 4? 6?  What is our best speed and method for turning?
* Then we are on to Line Folowing.
* We may use ultrasonic Ping sensors to keep a general consistent distance from the left wall.  If left wall distance is way off, check the right wall to coroborate.  
* Lastly, use a Digital Magnetic Compass to further get a sense to the car's direction on the track if needed.
